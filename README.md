# STEPPER APPLICATION

### About the Application

This React.js Stepper Application, developed with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, PostgreSQL, Prisma, Node.js, and Express.js, offers a seamless form-filling experience. Despite React's deprecation of Vite, its speed and features remain popular. The app includes email, phone, card validation, Prisma ORM integration, and CORS implementation.


### Features and Technologies used

1. Stepper Form: The application features a multi-step form, allowing users to input various types of information in separate sections.

2. Validations: Includes validations for email, phone number, card number, CVV, and expiry date to ensure accurate data entry.

3. Database Integration: Utilizes PostgreSQL database integration via Prisma for Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) to manage and persist data.

4. Responsive Design: Employs Tailwind CSS to create a responsive and mobile-friendly interface, ensuring optimal user experience across devices.

5. React Hooks: Leverages React hooks such as useState, useContext, and useEffect for efficient state management and side effect handling.

6. CORS Implementation: Implements CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) for securely handling requests from different origins, enhancing security and compatibility.

7. Render: Render is utilized for backend deployment, providing a reliable and scalable infrastructure to handle application requests efficiently.

8. Netlify: The frontend of the project is deployed on Netlify.
